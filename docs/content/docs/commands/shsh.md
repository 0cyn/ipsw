#### Dump shsh blob

Dumping shsh blobs allows you to downgrade iOS later.

```bash
$ ipsw shsh

   • Connecting to root@localhost:2222
      • Parsing shsh
      • Parsing IMG4
         • Dumped SHSH blob to 1249767383957670.dumped.shsh
```

> **NOTES:** This requires you have a jailbroken iDevice that you can ssh into.

I'd like to get to a 1-to-1 feature match with `jtool2` _(VERY close now)_

My main goal is to create a mantainable _dyld_shared_cache_ splitter

My strech goal is to make the worlds first _dyld_shared_cache_ disassembler that doesn't take days/a super computer 😏 to analyze

### TODO

- [ ] MachO read/write
- [ ] pure Go dyld splitter
- [ ] APFS/HFS parsing to pull dyld without mounting
- [ ] (jtool) -K Kextract™ a kernel extension by its bundle ID
- [ ] watch for new IPSW files with https://github.com/radovskyb/watcher
- [ ] https://github.com/xerub/img4lib and https://github.com/tihmstar/img4tool
- [ ] devicetree read/write
- [ ] add 💄https://github.com/muesli/termenv
- [ ] maybe use https://github.com/AllenDang/giu for disassembler
- [ ] add https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid to docs
- [ ] API maybe use (github.com/minio/simdjson-go)
